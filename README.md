# NURBS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TheBB/NURBS.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TheBB/NURBS.jl)

This package will implement functionality for manipulating NURBS objects (curves, surfaces, volumes,
etc.) in Julia.  This includes B-splines as a special case.

Currently very early in development.
